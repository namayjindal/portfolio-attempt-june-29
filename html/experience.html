                    <h2>Embedded Machine Learning Engineer at Quoppo Ventures</h2>
                    <p>At Quoppo Ventures, working as an Embedded Machine Learning Engineer was a deeply enriching experience. I contributed to developing fitness assessment bands for schools across India, utilizing Arduino and Zephyr RTOS to program sensors for reading IMU data and transmitting it at 20Hz to a mobile app. Collecting over 10,000 samples from 500+ sources was challenging but taught me the value of a robust dataset. Using Edge Impulse to create models for tracking exercise reps and deploying them to a Flutter app was incredibly fulfilling.</p>

                    <h2>Full Stack Engineering Intern at RecruitWizer</h2>
                    <p>My internship at RecruitWizer provided invaluable hands-on experience. I developed front-end components with Next.js and Tailwind and created a GPT-4 chatbot using LlamaIndex. Additionally, I managed server-side applications in FastAPI and updated MongoDB databases. Leading the Stripe payment portal integration, I implemented user checkout sessions, webhooks for customer subscriptions, and constructed APIs for various payment functions. This project enhanced my understanding of seamless user experience and backend functionality.</p>

                    <h2>Data Science Researcher at World Well-Being Project, UPenn</h2>
                    <p>As a Data Science Researcher at UPenn's World Well-Being Project, I worked on building pipelines to analyze over 10 million Reddit comments for empathy rating annotations. Using HPC, Pandas, and RegEx for data preprocessing was a significant learning experience. Fine-tuning models like Llama-2 and Gemma to improve empathy annotations and performing conversational training with ParlAI were challenging yet rewarding tasks. This project deepened my appreciation for data science and its applications in understanding human emotions.</p>

                    <p>During my internship at LaPosies, I played a key role in restructuring the e-commerce website using Wix and Shopify. This experience allowed me to work closely with a web development agency and frequently review HTML, CSS, and JavaScript codebases. The process led to a fourfold increase in daily orders, highlighting the impact of a well-designed website. I enjoyed the balance of creative and technical work, and it reinforced my passion for web development and enhancing user experience.</p>
